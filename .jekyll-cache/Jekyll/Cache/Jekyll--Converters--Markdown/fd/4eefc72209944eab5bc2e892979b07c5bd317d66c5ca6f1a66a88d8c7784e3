<p>My View on the Movie—Hachiko, a Dog’s Story</p>

<p>This movie, Hachiko, a Dog’s Story, is the one that has left the deepest impression on me. Not only because it tells us a heart-warming story, but also due to the reason it shows us that we are tied with our animal friends deeply forever and ever not just by loyalty, moreover, by friendship.</p>
